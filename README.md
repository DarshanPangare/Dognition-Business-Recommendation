# Dognition-Business-Recommendation-Using-Tableau
In this repo I made a Business recommendation to Dognition.com. 
All the tasks carried out were part of an assignment from the Coursera course 'Data Visualization and Communication using Tableau' offered by Duke University.
The Dognition data set was provided as a resource to the assignment.
The major tasks of the assignment were to: a) Determine Business issues b)Determine major factors contributing to the issue mentioned c)Analyze the Dognition data set provided d)Make a business recommendation linking the dataset analysis to the related issue.
All the visualizations were made using Tableau Public and a Business Recommendation report(Week 5 Assignment script.docx) was developed in MS-Excel.
